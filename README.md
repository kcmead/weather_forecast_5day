# weather_forecast_5day

## Description

I created a weather forecast page that shows today's weather, in addition to what you can expect for the next 5 days.  The project features a recently searched cities result which enables the user to see the other cities that have already been searched.

The weather details include temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity, and an image icon for a visual display of the weather.

The website uses an API that directly connects to the Open Weather Service.

This website is intended to be a learning exercise for the things I've been learning in javascript as the course progresses.  There may be some more updates in the future as I learn more.
